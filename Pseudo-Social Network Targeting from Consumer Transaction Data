Abstract
This design science paper presents a method for targeting consumers based on a 'pseudo-social network' (PSN): 
consumers are linked if they transfer money to the same entities. A marketer can target those individuals that 
are strongly connected to key individuals. We present the PSN design and a large-scale empirical study using data 
from a major bank. For two different product offerings, consumers that are close to existing customers in the PSN 
have significantly higher take rates thanthe 'most likely' candidates identified by state-of-the-artsocio-demographic (SD) 
predictive modeling. Interestingly, the PSN targeting only does better for the closest neighbors. However, the different 
models capture different information: combining the two does significantly better than either alone. The results
demonstrate that social targeting can be applied broadly, to settings where the network among consumers is unlikely 
to be a true social network, but nonetheless captures inherent similarity.
